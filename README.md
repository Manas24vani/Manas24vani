ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manas. I'm a graduate student at Pace University. I am passionate about data. My goal is to display my work and document the process of EDA and ML models that I build. The github pages will also serve as a way for me to reflect/revisit my past work. For job opportunities feel free to reach out at - manas.a.vani@pace.edu

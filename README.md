ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manas vani. I'm a graduate student at Pace University. I am interested in everything related to Data Science. 
- In my profile the Chocolate Hackathon is the project for Dataiku hackathon. My group ended up at 3rd in the competition out of 35 teams. 
- The second project displays how I used python to do EDA on a dataset and then used the streamlit library to make a dashboard out of it.
